## About The Giving History App  

### Background 
This app is designed to assist finance staff when compiling federal giving history reports. It replaces tedious calculations with a simple file upload.  

### What the App Does

The app takes in a *CSV* of federal giving history which can be download from [here](http://data.influenceexplorer.com/contributions/#Y29udHJpYnV0b3JfZnQ9Sm9obiUyMERvZSZnZW5lcmFsX3RyYW5zYWN0aW9uX3R5cGU9c3RhbmRhcmQ=). An example csv file can be found on my Githud account, **here**

The app then runs the following calculations:   
1. Creates a data frame with the necessary information - *year, amount,* and *recipient*  
2. Adds up the total amount given to each recipient per year  
3. Orders the data frame in descending order by year and then amount  
4. Allows the user to then download the resulting data.
